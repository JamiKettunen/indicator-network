System Settings Server/Client
=============================

Both Server and Client applications are using cmake as default build tool.
This file will guide you to compile these applications.


1. SERVER
=========

The Server application is the application which make available the menu
structure over dbus.

2. CLIENT
=========

The client side application read the information exported by the server and
create a QML menu structure based on this information

3. COMPILING
============

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../


3. EXAMPLES
===========

To test the current implementation you should run the server and client
application simultaneous. To do that follow the steps below:

In the build directory(<project-dir>/build):
    ./server/export-settings-menu ../server/xml/test.xml &
    ./client/examples/run-client-app.sh
